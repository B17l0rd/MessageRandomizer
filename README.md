# Dragon ball fight generator
- On this project the program selects a random character hero,villain,and place from 3 different lists 
- Randomize and saves the selections in memory 
- And then presents them in a string that is always  randomizing both hero and villain as well as the place of the fight !


# Purpose:
- As part of my learning curve on codecademy ,this is a project to practice JavaScript, and get more familiar using  Git and GitHub

# How to use :
+ Use the code editor of you choice and preview the page 
+ F12 to open console  and the use the Function “setUp()”
+ And that’s it should be working just fine 





###### I intend to come back to this project later on and create the full fight therefore giving you the winer !!
